My Tasks:
- When you click on an event, it downloads a google calendar file

Roadmap of Items to Change:

- Updating the nav bar:
    1. userTopLocation: Fetch the top of the screen of the user
    2. screenTopLocation: Fetch an array of 'possible sections' by iterating window.innerHeight * index
    3. Iterate from the first screen top location:
        IF userTopLocation is BELOW screenTopLocation[i]
            return highlighted section

- Make the scrolling bar free instead of fixed between sections.
- Make the blobs interactible on desktop and not on mobile?
- Figure out code error on Navigation.js
- Make "Boston College" and "Computer Science Society" text a foreground element
- Text on titles must scale down dynamically on mobile
- Fix the container bug.
